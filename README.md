A simple MIDI editor designed to make custom song charts for HYPERBEAT

I did use AI to help on the coding side of this. I think AI is cringe, I would not use it normally, but this is a simple free tool and stuff like this is very outside of my skillset.

Instructions:

Download latest version from releases on the right
Extract and run the exe

For best results, songs are ideally a consistent tempo and the start of the file starts on the downbeat.

Find the tempo of the song online (use a tap tempo website if needed) 
Load your audio file (wav or ogg only)
Set your tempo in the BPM spinbox

Drag out the right panel all the way to find hotkeys and information


Known issues/Planned changes:
Center notes don't have the same velocity context menu as the edge notes
Can't change multiple notes note type or length when all are selected
No Undo/Redo yet
Spacebar needs proper mapping to play/pause
Tap Tempo and possibly auto-offset adjustment


Please direct any issues and suggestions to @soothsayer on discord, my DMs are open and I am in the hyperbeat discord also.
